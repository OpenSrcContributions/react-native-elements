# React Native Elements App

**[Mobile App](https://expo.dev/@rneui/react-native-elements)**

This is the Demo app for [React Native Elements](https://expo.dev/@rneui/react-native-elements) built with [Expo](https://expo.io/). The purpose of this app is to demonstrate the usage of the various UI components that React Native Elements provides out of the box.

This app also works on the `web` platform using [React Native Web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web). If you are looking to build a React Native mobile app which can reuse the code to deploy it on the web, this is the right place to begin. We decided to use [Expo](https://expo.io/), which reduces the effort required to build an app once and deploy it anywhere.

## Getting Started

### Run it locally

1. Install [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/workflow/expo-cli/)

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

## Learn more

To learn more about developing your project with Expo, look at the following resources:

- [Expo documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/): Learn fundamentals, or go into advanced topics with our [guides](https://docs.expo.dev/guides).
- [Learn Expo tutorial](https://docs.expo.dev/tutorial/introduction/): Follow a step-by-step tutorial where you'll create a project that runs on Android, iOS, and the web.

## Join the community

Join our community of developers creating universal apps.

```bash
# Using Yarn
yarn eject

# Using npm
npm run eject
```

We highly recommend you read the [official Expo ejection docs](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/expokit/eject/) before proceeding, as the action of ejecting is not reversible.
